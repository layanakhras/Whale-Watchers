Project Whale Watcher

Project Whale Watcher is a database-driven text-based application designed to explore whale sighting data, 
allowing users to filter sightings based on various criteria such as certainty, category, 
whale group size, sighting date, and more.

I used Python for frontend, MySQL for backend, and the matlibplot and folium libraries to generate visuals.

My long term goal for this project is to turn it into a web-based application.
